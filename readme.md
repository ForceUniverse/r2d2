Part of the Dart Force Framework.

A library to detect the device you are on!

#### Walkthrough ####

This is how you setup and use device detection clientside:

	ClientDetectDevice cd = new ClientDetectDevice();
	cd.isTablet();
	cd.isMobile();
	cd.isDesktop();
	
This is how you setup and use device detection serverside:

	ServerDetectDevice cd = new ServerDetectDevice();
	cd.isTablet();
	cd.isMobile();
	cd.isDesktop();
