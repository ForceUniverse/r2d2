When you use the top-level\nfunctions, it will assume the current platform's path style and work with\nthat. If you want to explicitly work with paths of a specific style, you can\nconstruct a <code>path.Context</code> for that style.</p>\n<h2>Using</h2>\n<p>The path library was designed to be imported with a prefix, though you don't\nhave to if you don't want to:</p>\n<pre><code>import 'package:path/path.dart' as path;\n</code></pre>\n<p>The most common way to use the library is through the top-level functions.\nThese manipulate path strings based on your current working directory and\nthe path style (POSIX, Windows, or URLs) of the host platform. For example:</p>\n<pre><code>path.join(\"directory\", \"file.txt\");\n</code></pre>\n<p>This calls the top-level join function to join \"directory\" and\n\"file.txt\" using the current platform's directory separator.</p>\n<p>If you want to work with paths for a specific platform regardless of the\nunderlying platform that the program is running on, you can create a\nContext and give it an explicit Style:</p>\n<pre><code>var context = new path.Context(style: Style.windows);\ncontext.join(\"directory\", \"file.txt\");\n</code></pre>\n<p>This will join \"directory\" and \"file.txt\" using the Windows path separator,\neven when the program is run on a POSIX machine.</p>\n<h2>FAQ</h2>\n<h3>Where can I use this?</h3>\n<p>Pathos runs on the Dart VM and in the browser under both dart2js and Dartium.\nUnder dart2js, it currently returns \".\" as the current working directory, while\nunder Dartium it returns the current URL.</p>\n<h3>Why doesn't this make paths first-class objects?</h3>\n<p>When you have path <em>objects</em>, then every API that takes a path has to decide if\nit accepts strings, path objects, or both.</p><ul><li>\n<p>Accepting strings is the most convenient, but then it seems weird to have\nthese path objects that aren't actually accepted by anything that needs a\npath. Once you've created a path, you have to always call <code>.toString()</code> on\nit before you can do anything useful with it.</p></li><li>\n<p>Requiring objects forces users to wrap path strings in these objects, which\nis tedious. It also means coupling that API to whatever library defines this\npath class. If there are multiple \"path\" libraries that each define their\nown path types, then any library that works with paths has to pick which one\nit uses.</p></li><li>\n<p>Taking both means you can't type your API. That defeats the purpose of\nhaving a path type: why have a type if your APIs can't annotate that they\nexpect it?</p></li></ul>\n<p>Given that, we've decided this library should simply treat paths as strings.</p>\n<h3>How cross-platform is this?</h3>\n<p>We believe this library handles most of the corner cases of Windows paths\n(POSIX paths are generally pretty straightforward):</p><ul><li>\n<p>It understands that <em>both</em> \"/\" and \"\\\" are valid path separators, not just\n\"\\\".</p></li><li>\n<p>It can accurately tell if a path is absolute based on drive-letters or UNC\nprefix.</p></li><li>\n<p>It understands that \"/foo\" is not an absolute path on Windows.</p></li><li>\n<p>It knows that \"C:\\foo\\one.txt\" and \"c:/foo\\two.txt\" are two files in the\nsame directory.</p></li></ul>\n<h3>What is a \"path\" in the browser?</h3>\n<p>If you use this package in a browser, then it considers the \"platform\" to be\nthe browser itself and uses URL strings to represent \"browser paths\".</p>"},{"packageName":"r2d2","name":"artoo_client","qualifiedName":"r2d2/artoo_client","packageIntro":""},{"packageName":"r2d2","name":"artoo_common","qualifiedName":"r2d2/artoo_common","packageIntro":""},{"packageName":"r2d2","name":"artoo_server","qualifiedName":"r2d2/artoo_server","packageIntro":""},{"packageName":"stack_trace","name":"stack_trace","qualifiedName":"stack_trace/stack_trace","preview":"<p>Stack trace generation and parsing.</p>","packageIntro":"<p>This library provides the ability to parse, inspect, and manipulate stack traces\nproduced by the underlying Dart implementation.

For\nexample:</p>\n<pre><code>dart:core                                   Object.noSuchMethod\npkg/stack_trace/lib/src/trace.dart 47:21    Trace.terse.&lt;fn&gt;\ndart:core                                   List.reduce\npkg/stack_trace/lib/src/trace.dart 40:35    Trace.terse\npkg/stack_trace/lib/stack_trace.dart 24:28  format\ntest.dart 21:29                             main.&lt;fn&gt;\ndart:async                                  Timer.Timer.&lt;fn&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Stack Chains</h2>\n<p>This library also provides the ability to capture \"stack chains\" with the\n<code>Chain</code> class. When writing asynchronous code, a single stack trace isn't very\nuseful, since the call stack is unwound every time something async happens. A\nstack chain tracks stack traces through asynchronous calls, so that you can see\nthe full path from <code>main</code> down to the error.</p>\n<p>To use stack chains, just wrap the code that you want to track in\n<code>Chain.capture</code>. This will create a new <a href=\"https://api.dartlang.org/apidocs/channels/stable/#dart-async.Zone\">Zone</a> in which stack traces are\nrecorded and woven into chains every time an asynchronous call occurs. Zones are\nsticky, too, so any asynchronous operations started in the <code>Chain.capture</code>\ncallback will have their chains tracked, as will asynchronous operations they\nstart and so on.</p>\n<p>Here's an example of some code that doesn't capture its stack chains:</p>\n<pre class=\"dart\"><code>import 'dart:async';\n\nvoid main() {\n  scheduleAsync();\n}\n\nvoid scheduleAsync() {\n  return new Future.delayed(new Duration(seconds: 1))\n      .then((_) =&gt; runAsync());\n}\n\nvoid runAsync() {\n  throw 'oh no!';\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>If we run this, it prints the following:</p>\n<pre><code>Uncaught Error: oh no!\nStack Trace: \n#0      runAsync (file:///usr/local/google-old/home/goog/dart/dart/test.dart:13:3)\n#1      scheduleAsync.&lt;anonymous closure&gt; (file:///usr/local/google-old/home/goog/dart/dart/test.dart:9:28)\n#2      _rootRunUnary (dart:async/zone.dart:717)\n#3      _RootZone.runUnary (dart:async/zone.dart:854)\n#4      _Future._propagateToListeners.handleValueCallback (dart:async/future_impl.dart:488)\n#5      _Future._propagateToListeners (dart:async/future_impl.dart:571)\n#6      _Future._complete (dart:async/future_impl.dart:317)\n#7      _SyncCompleter.complete (dart:async/future_impl.dart:44)\n#8      Future.Future.delayed.&lt;anonymous closure&gt; (dart:async/future.dart:219)\n#9      _createTimer.&lt;anonymous closure&gt; (dart:async-patch/timer_patch.dart:11)\n#10     _handleTimeout (dart:io/timer_impl.dart:292)\n#11     _RawReceivePortImpl._handleMessage (dart:isolate-patch/isolate_patch.dart:115)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Notice how there's no mention of <code>main</code> in that stack trace. All we know is that\nthe error was in <code>runAsync</code>; we don't know why <code>runAsync</code> was called.</p>\n<p>Now let's look at the same code with stack chains captured:</p>\n<pre class=\"dart\"><code>import 'dart:async';\n\nimport 'package:stack_trace/stack_trace.dart';\n\nvoid main() {\n  Chain.capture(() {\n    scheduleAsync();\n  });\n}\n\nvoid scheduleAsync() {\n  new Future.delayed(new Duration(seconds: 1))\n      .then((_) =&gt; runAsync());\n}\n\nvoid runAsync() {\n  throw 'oh no!';\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now if we run it, it prints this:</p>\n<pre><code>Uncaught Error: oh no!\nStack Trace: \ntest.dart 17:3                                                runAsync\ntest.dart 13:28                                               scheduleAsync.&lt;fn&gt;\npackage:stack_trace/src/stack_zone_specification.dart 129:26  registerUnaryCallback.&lt;fn&gt;.&lt;fn&gt;\npackage:stack_trace/src/stack_zone_specification.dart 174:15  StackZoneSpecification._run\npackage:stack_trace/src/stack_zone_specification.dart 177:7   StackZoneSpecification._run\npackage:stack_trace/src/stack_zone_specification.dart 175:7   StackZoneSpecification._run\npackage:stack_trace/src/stack_zone_specification.dart 129:18  registerUnaryCallback.&lt;fn&gt;\ndart:async/zone.dart 717                                      _rootRunUnary\ndart:async/zone.dart 449                                      _ZoneDelegate.runUnary\ndart:async/zone.dart 654                                      _CustomizedZone.runUnary\ndart:async/future_impl.dart 488                               _Future._propagateToListeners.handleValueCallback\ndart:async/future_impl.dart 571                               _Future._propagateToListeners\ndart:async/future_impl.dart 317                               _Future._complete\ndart:async/future_impl.dart 44                                _SyncCompleter.complete\ndart:async/future.dart 219                                    Future.Future.delayed.&lt;fn&gt;\npackage:stack_trace/src/stack_zone_specification.dart 174:15  StackZoneSpecification._run\npackage:stack_trace/src/stack_zone_specification.dart 119:52  registerCallback.&lt;fn&gt;\ndart:async/zone.dart 706                                      _rootRun\ndart:async/zone.dart 440                                      _ZoneDelegate.run\ndart:async/zone.dart 650                                      _CustomizedZone.run\ndart:async/zone.dart 561                                      _BaseZone.runGuarded\ndart:async/zone.dart 586                                      _BaseZone.bindCallback.&lt;fn&gt;\npackage:stack_trace/src/stack_zone_specification.dart 174:15  StackZoneSpecification._run\npackage:stack_trace/src/stack_zone_specification.dart 119:52  registerCallback.&lt;fn&gt;\ndart:async/zone.dart 710                                      _rootRun\ndart:async/zone.dart 440                                      _ZoneDelegate.run\ndart:async/zone.dart 650                                      _CustomizedZone.run\ndart:async/zone.dart 561                                      _BaseZone.runGuarded\ndart:async/zone.dart 586                                      _BaseZone.bindCallback.&lt;fn&gt;\ndart:async-patch/timer_patch.dart 11                          _createTimer.&lt;fn&gt;\ndart:io/timer_impl.dart 292                                   _handleTimeout\ndart:isolate-patch/isolate_patch.dart 115                     _RawReceivePortImpl._handleMessage\n===== asynchronous gap ===========================\ndart:async/zone.dart 476                   _ZoneDelegate.registerUnaryCallback\ndart:async/zone.dart 666                   _CustomizedZone.registerUnaryCallback\ndart:async/future_impl.dart 164            _Future._Future._then\ndart:async/future_impl.dart 187            _Future.then\ntest.dart 13:12                            scheduleAsync\ntest.dart 7:18                             main.&lt;fn&gt;\ndart:async/zone.dart 710                   _rootRun\ndart:async/zone.dart 440                   _ZoneDelegate.run\ndart:async/zone.dart 650                   _CustomizedZone.run\ndart:async/zone.dart 944                   runZoned\npackage:stack_trace/src/chain.dart 93:20   Chain.capture\ntest.dart 6:16                             main\ndart:isolate-patch/isolate_patch.dart 216  _startIsolate.isolateStartHandler\ndart:isolate-patch/isolate_patch.dart 115  _RawReceivePortImpl._handleMessage\n</code></pre>\n<p>That's a lot of text!
